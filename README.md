# Predict_coffee_price
This project focuses on forecasting coffee prices using historical data related to temperature, gas prices, and oil prices. The project involves data preprocessing, visualization, and feature engineering to identify significant factors affecting coffee prices. A Random Forest Regressor is used as the primary model for prediction, with alternative models like Support Vector Regression (SVR) also explored. 
Key findings include a positive correlation between temperature and coffee prices, with the highest prices observed at temperatures around 30 to 32 degrees Celsius. This project highlights the use of data analysis and machine learning to provide actionable insights for the coffee market.
